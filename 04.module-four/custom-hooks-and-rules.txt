React official documentation - https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks


Rules to use hooks in React: - 
    - Call inside a custom hook / react functional components.
    - Call hooks at the top level of the custom hook/components.
    - Only call hooks from the react functional components.


Hooks are nothing but JavaScript functions. In react, functions whose names starts using `use` are called hooks. (useState, useEffect, useRef).

And to create a custom react hook, you have to use the same naming convention to help react understand that it is a hook and optimize it accordingly.

Where we cannot use/declare a React hooks: - 
    - Inside a loop.
    - Inside a conditional statement.
    - Inside class components.
    - Inside try/catch/finally blocks.
