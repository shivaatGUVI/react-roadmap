A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that interacts with the web browser by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of the browser loading entire new pages.

Key Characteristics of SPA's: - 

1. Dynamic Content Update: - SPAs update the content of the current page dynamically, without requiring full page reloads. This is achieved by fetching data asynchronously from the server and updating the DOM (Document Object Model) accordingly.

2. No Full Page Reloads: - Unlike traditional multi-page applications, SPAs do not reload the entire page when navigating between different sections or views. Instead, they load the necessary content inline within the same page, reducing the need for full page reloads.

3. Improved User Experience: - SPAs provide a seamless and responsive user experience by minimizing page transitions and ensuring that the application remains interactive and responsive throughout.

4. Component-Based Architecture: - SPAs are built using component-based architectures, where individual components are designed to be reusable and interchangeable. This approach simplifies the development and maintenance of complex applications.
