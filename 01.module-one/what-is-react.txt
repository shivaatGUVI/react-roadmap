React, also known as ReactJS, is a powerful JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces. It has gained immense popularity for its efficiency in creating dynamic and interactive web applications.

Features of React: - 

1. Component-Based Architecture: - React revolves around components, allowing developers to break down the UI into smaller, self-contained pieces that can have their own state and props.

2. JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension): - JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that enables developers to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript files, making React components more readable and expressive.

3. Unidirectional Data Flow and Flux: - React implements one-way data flow, simplifying app logic, and Flux is a pattern that aids in maintaining unidirectional data flow.
