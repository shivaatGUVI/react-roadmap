NPM stands for Node Package Manager.

It is a crucial tool in web development, particluarly for JavaScript and Node.js projects. It serves multiple functions which are as follows: - 

1. Software Registry
    NPM is renowned as the world's largest software registry, housing over 800,000 code packages. It serves as a platform where open-source developers can share their software creations, and organizations can manage their private development projects.

2. Package Manager
    NPM is not just a registry but also a package manager and installer. It allows developers to manage dependencies efficiently by installing all the necessary dependencies of a project with a single command. These dependencies are defined in a file called package.json, which must include essential fields like name and version.

3. Sharing you Software
    For developers looking to share their software on the npm registry, they can publish any directory from their computer as long as it contains a package.json file. This process involves logging in, navigating to the project directory, and executing the npm publish command.
